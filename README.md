Arvid from the website m8raw2dng created a program to convert Leica M8 RAW files (16-bit container with 14-bit of data) to DNG format (8-bit).
This conversion helps particular in low light.  Typically one would not shoot the M8 past 640 but with the conversion files with 2500 are very 
much useable.  Please see included RAW file as an example ( Run the script to get the DNG output ).

* I edited the Apple Script Droplet to do the conversion in the current working directory so the folder is portable.  
* Previously you would have to edit the script and have one designated location and reading through numerous forums,
many people had issues with this task.
